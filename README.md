# BestBitcoinPrice


## What I built
A tiny full-stack application that fetches Bitcoin (BTC) prices from two public sources, normalizes them, and displays the **best (highest) sell price** along with a list of all exchanges.  
- **Backend:** Node.js (Express)  
- **Frontend:** React (Vite)

## How to Run

### Backend
```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm run start

cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
